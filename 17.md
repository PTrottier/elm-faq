This page concerns questions that arose with Elm version 0.17.

For general questions see the [main FAQ page](index.html).

### Where are the official documents about Elm version 0.17?

* [A Farewell to FRP][farewell]: Evan's blog announcement of Elm 0.17.
* [Upgrading to 0.17][upgrade guide]: The official upgrade guide.
* [Introduction to Elm][guide]: The official guide to the Elm 0.17 language and core packages.

Others have written about the conversion as well:

* [Migrating signal usage from Elm 0.16 to 0.17](http://noredink.github.io/posts/signalsmigration.html)

### Why does elm-make complain "Cannot find module 'Basics'"?

You need to install the elm-lang/core package.

This often arises when upgrading a package from 0.16 after removing all dependencies from elm-package.json.

### Where is the evancz/elm-html package?

It's now at elm-lang/html. See the [upgrade guide] about this and other core packages that moved.

[farewell]: http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp
[upgrade guide]: https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.17.md
[guide]: http://guide.elm-lang.org/

### Where is `Effects.task`?

It's gone. `Task.perform` is used instead.

See some examples of [how to convert to Task.perform](17-tasks.html).

### Why am I getting "TypeError: Elm.embed is not a function"?

The JavaScript code for calling the Elm entry point must now look like this:

```javascript
Elm.MyApp.embed(someElement);
```

It used to look like `Elm.embed(Elm.MyApp, someElement)`.

It's similar for the `fullscreen` and `worker` functions.

### What happened to all the core modules?

Many core modules have been moved out into separate packages, usually under `elm-lang`.

* `Graphics` is now in `evancz/elm-graphics`
* `Trampoline` is now in `elm-lang/trampoline` and has some renames
  * `Trampoline.trampoline` is now `Trampoline.evaluate`
  * `Trampoline.Done` is now `Trampoline.done` (function instead of constructor)
  * `Trampoline.Continue` is now `Trampoline.jump` (function instead of constructor)
* `Mouse` is now in `elm-lang/mouse`
* `Window` is now in `elm-lang/window`
* `Keyboard` is now in `elm-lang/keyboard`

Also:

* `maxsnew/lazy` is now `elm-lang/lazy`

### What is now in elm-community?

* `NoRedInk/elm-lazy-list` is now `elm-community/elm-lazy-list`
* `NoRedInk/elm-random-extra` is now `elm-community/random-extra`
  * `Random.Bool` has been removed as it is now in `elm-lang/core`'s `Random`
  * `Random.Function` has been removed entirely
* `deadfoxygrandpa/elm-test` is now `elm-community/elm-test`
  * It no longer depends on `laszlopandy/elm-console`. To run tests in node use: `ElmTest.runSuite`
  * `elementRunner` is gone, use `runSuiteHtml` instead

### Why am I getting "cannot find module" errors while upgrading a project from 0.16?

Cached or obsolete/renamed package versions may be getting in the way. To get a clean start, try these (from simplest to most drastic):

1. Remove all of elm-stuff.
2. Remove all the package names from the `dependencies` section of elm-package.json and install packages again as needed. You may have to explicitly install elm-lang/core again.
3. Remove all of ~/.elm (on linux or Mac OSX) or ~/AppData/Roaming/elm/package (on Windows).

### Does hot-reloading work in elm-reactor now?

Not yet. Work is well underway to improve elm-reactor.

### Why does the compiler complain about "I am looking for one of the following things: whitespace" near the beginning of the file?

The `exposing` clause is now required at the beginning of each module.
For example, you now need `module Foo exposing (..)` where prior to Elm 0.17 you could use `module Foo where`.


### Are static ports still available?

No. In Elm 0.17 you'll have to pass any static data from JS to Elm via the "flags" argument to the `embed()`, `fullscreen()`, or `worker()` functions.

### Why does elm-make report "I cannot find module 'Graphics.Collage'" even though evancz/elm-graphics is installed?

You now need to do `import Collage` to get that module. It's no longer namespaced under `Graphics`.
